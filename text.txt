SolarWinds cyber attack

In 2020 hackers broke into Texas-based SolarWind's systems and added malicious code into the company's software system. The system is called Orion.
The company had no idea they have been hacked, so they sent out updates to customers and nearly half of them installed the update, which had the hacked code. 
The code opened a back door to the customers information
18,000 installed the update
It happened so stealthy that it went unoticed for months.
I would say they messed up on not double checking their update before releasing it to there customers
They beileve the Russians did it, but denied the whole thing
They had access to email accounts and other vital information. including parts of the pentagon and other government agencies like homeland security
The also got access to big companies like, Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, and Deloitte.
But for some reason they didn't access any classified information, it was all un-classified

This attack really opened our eyes that we need more cybersecurity, even though it is expensive and a lot of work. 
The first company to notice they have been hacked was, FireEye, a private cybersecurity company.
The company SolarWinds is a big company with a lot of big customers, so they have spent a ton of money to make sure something like this dosn't happen again.
We are lucky the hackers didn't hack into all of the classified information because they had their hacked code in the software system 'Orion' for a couple months with nobody noticing.
The IRS stated that they did not get hacked when this happened, which is good because they have everyones information and bank.
